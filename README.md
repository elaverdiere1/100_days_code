# 100_days_code
Started the 100 days of code using a Udemy course.  I will add all my code projects from the days to this repo.

Day 1 is a simple name generator

Day 2 is a tip calculator that tells you what each person in a group should pay at a restaurant based on the bill and tip

Day 3 is a short choose your adventure game

Day 4 is a rock paper scissors game against the computer

Day 5 is a random password generator

Day 6 is a challenge from the site Reeborg's World and is solving the maze

I have written the code but all projects and code ideas for each day are from the Udemy course https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/
